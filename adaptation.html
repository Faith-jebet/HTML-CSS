            <h2>Adaptation Strategies for Farmers</h2>
            <p>Farmers can take the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plant drought-resistant crops.</li>
                <p>Example of drought resistant crops:</p>
                <ol><li> Quinoa</li>
                <li>Millet</li>
                <li>Sorghum</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <li>Improve soil quality through sustainable practices.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Implement water-saving technologies.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Maize: Maize thrives in warm temperatures between 60-95°F (15-35°C) <br>
                        with well-distributed rainfall or irrigation during the growing season. 
                        <br>It requires a frost-free growing season of about 90-120 days.
                </li>
                <li>Potatoes: Potatoes prefer cool climates with temperatures between 60-70°F (15-21°C) during the<br>growing season.They require well-drained, loose soil with consistent moisture.</li>
          <li>Sorghum: Sorghum is a warm-season crop that prefers temperatures between 75-85°F (24-29°C) during the growing season. <br>It is relatively drought-tolerant and can grow in areas with limited rainfall.
        </li>
        <li>Wheat: Wheat grows best in cool, temperate climates with temperatures between 50-70°F (10-21°C).<br> It requires well-drained soil and adequate moisture during its growth stages.</li>
           <li>Potatoes: Potatoes prefer cool climates with temperatures between 60-70°F (15-21°C) during the growing season.<br> They require well-drained, loose soil with consistent moisture.
        </li>
        <li>Beans: Beans prefer warm temperatures ranging from 70-80°F (21-27°C) during the day and slightly cooler nights.<br> They require well-drained soil and regular, even moisture.</li>
    </ol>
